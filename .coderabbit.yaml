            Max line length is 88 characters.
            Use Google-style docstrings with Args and Returns sections
            unless a more specific path instruction overrides this requirement.
            Keep explanations concise and focused on the cultural event management domain.
            Mention connections between users, events, organizers, places and speakers when relevant.
      - path: "**/views/**/*.py"
        instructions: |
            Do not add Args and Returns sections for Django overrides.
      - path: "**/tests/**/*.py"
        instructions: |
            Do not add Args and Returns sections for methods that start with test_.
            Mention the expected outcome.
            Use the "who / when / what" pattern if applicable.
            Avoid duplicating internal logic or implementation details.
  unit_tests:
    path_instructions:
      - path: "**/*.py"
        instructions: |
            Unit tests use **pytest** framework with fixtures and **factory-boy** for object creation.
            Avoid using mocks unless absolutely necessary for **external services**
            (e.g., Google APIs for spreadsheets or email notifications).
            When mocks are needed, use the built-in **mocker** fixture provided by pytest.
            **Reuse existing fixtures whenever possible** instead of creating new ones without need.
