            Mention connections between users, events, organizers, places and speakers when relevant.

context: |
  This project is for desparchado.co â€” a website that allows users to add cultural events in Colombia
  so others can see them, giving the events more visibility and promotion.

  Authenticated users can add and edit events, while anyone can view published and approved events.
  Each event includes:
    - Organizers: people or organizations (such as libraries, museums or cultural centers) that run the event.
    - Place: a physical location in Colombia where the event happens.
    - Speakers: people who talk or present during the event.

  The code uses Django and includes models, views, and forms to manage events and their related data.
  The dashboard app is available only to admin users and is used for monitoring, administration, and bulk event imports from spreadsheets.
